# 1. Mount Google Drive and Load Data

file_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/Datasets/logistic/creditcard.csv" 
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
print("Data loaded successfully.")

# 2. Prepare Data
# Features V1-V28 are already scaled. 'Time' and 'Amount' are not.
numeric_features_to_scale = ['Time', 'Amount']

# 3. Split Data
# --- CRITICAL: stratify=y ensures both train and test sets have the same (imbalanced) class proportion ---

    remainder='passthrough' # Keep V1-V28 as they are
)

# 5. Initialize and Train Model
# --- CRITICAL: class_weight='balanced' tells the model to penalize errors on the minority class (fraud) more heavily ---

# 6. Evaluate Model

print("Code placeholder for creditcard.csv. Note 'stratify=y' and 'class_weight=balanced'.")
