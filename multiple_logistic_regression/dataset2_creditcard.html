# 1. Mount Google Drive and Load Data
# drive.mount('/content/drive')
# file_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/creditcard.csv" 
# df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
# print("Data loaded successfully.")

# 2. Prepare Data
# Features V1-V28 are already scaled. 'Time' and 'Amount' are not.
# numeric_features_to_scale = ['Time', 'Amount']
# passthrough_features = [f'V{i}' for i in range(1, 29)]
# target = 'Class'

# X = df[numeric_features_to_scale + passthrough_features]
# y = df[target]

# 3. Split Data
# --- CRITICAL: stratify=y ensures both train and test sets have the same (imbalanced) class proportion ---
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# 4. Preprocessing
# preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
#     transformers=[
#         ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_features_to_scale)
#     ],
#     remainder='passthrough' # Keep V1-V28 as they are
# )
# X_train_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X_train)
# X_test_processed = preprocessor.transform(X_test)

# 5. Initialize and Train Model
# --- CRITICAL: class_weight='balanced' tells the model to penalize errors on the minority class (fraud) more heavily ---
# model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, class_weight='balanced')
# model.fit(X_train_processed, y_train)

# 6. Evaluate Model
# y_pred = model.predict(X_test_processed)
# print("\nClassification Report (Focus on Recall for Class 1):")
# print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

print("Code placeholder for creditcard.csv. Note 'stratify=y' and 'class_weight=balanced'.")
